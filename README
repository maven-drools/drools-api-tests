These are a few tests against various versions of the Drools APIs to ensure
that Drools provides the basic services and features which are essential for
correct functioning of the maven-drools-plugin.

Without correct functioning of these, the plugin cannot work reliably, since
it relies on the functionality tested herein.

The list of tests is not complete. That is, all tests green does not ensure
correct working of the plugin (this is done by the plugin's integration tests),
but a *non* working test indicates a problem with a specific Drools version.


This project uses Maven Profiles to control which Drools version to run the tests
against. So when running the tests, please make sure to activate *exactly* one profile.
The profile names can be obtained from the POM or your favourite IDE after importing
the pom.xml as a Maven project.
